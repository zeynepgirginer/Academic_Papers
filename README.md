# Academic_Papers
A collection of academic essays and research papers written across microeconomics, market design, and policy analysis. These papers reflect structured reasoning, clear argumentation, structured analytical writing, and the ability to translate economic models into real-world insights. Together, they showcase my ability to work with theory, build models, evaluate policy proposals, and communicate complex ideas clearly.



## Included Papers



### **1. Insights into LCPIH and MPC**



A compact research note analyzing the Life-Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis and the determinants of the marginal propensity to consume. The paper discusses theoretical foundations, empirical evidence, and behavioral deviations affecting consumption dynamics.



### **2. Supplying Kidneys: Argumentative Essay** 



An evidence-based argument evaluating whether a regulated market for kidneys could reduce shortages, eliminate black-market inefficiencies, and improve welfare. The essay synthesizes real-world case studies (e.g. Iran), economic logic, and ethical critique.



### **3. Matching with Contracts Algorithm** 



A full mechanism-design paper proposing a tenant-landlord matching system for the Turkish rental market using a one-to-one matching-with-contracts framework. Builds on Gale-Shapley, Hatfield-Milgrom, substitutability, IRC, stability, strategy-proofness, and Pareto efficiency.



## What This Repository Demonstrates



* Strong conceptual understanding of **microeconomic theory**, **market design**, and **incentive structures**

* Ability to translate theoretical models into **practical real-world mechanisms**

* Structured academic writing: clear abstracts, motivation, formal modeling, and formal proofs

* Experience synthesizing empirical and theoretical insights

* Clarity in policy argumentation and data-driven reasoning



## Purpose



This repository complements my technical work (see **Data-Science-Portfolio**).

While the other repo highlights analytical coding, modeling, and statistical proficiency, this one demonstrates:



* theoretical depth

* academic rigor

* policy and mechanism-design thinking

* the ability to articulate complex ideas



Both together reflect full-stack analytical capability: **from theory to implementation**.
